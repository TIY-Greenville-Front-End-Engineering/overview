# Software Engineering Reading List

These books will not make you an amazing programmer. However, writting lots of code where you apply concepts from them probably will. Many of these books taught me concepts that I implimented on the job, which often resulted in a promotion or pay raise.

This list does NOT include books like [JavaScript the Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do) or [Two Scoops of Django](https://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/0981467342), though I believe you should include some language/framework specific books based on what technologies you end up working with. Instead, this list is designed to be foundational for a career as a software engineer. Many of these books are part of computer science curriculum at Drexel, MIT, and Berkeley.

Don't try to read everything all at once. Spend 2 years reading and applying the concepts from the books on this list. The list is not in any particular order, but as I look over the list, they appear to be roughly in the order I read them.

## Getting Started

These books are beautiful and give the web developer beginer some entry level details. At this point you know all of this, but if you have friends that ask to learn web development I would recommend these:

 * [HTML & CSS (Jon Duckett)](https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189)
 * [JavaScript & jQuery (Jon Duckett)](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=FC4GCT5K43083FZKY136)

## After Graduation

### Software

 * [Code Complete](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670)  

	Note: Code Complete is all about Software Craftsmanship. It deals with how to write code that isn't garbage. Treat this as a reference and read the chapters that apply to issues that you're facing on the job. I got my first big promotion after applying concepts from just the first nine chapters.
 	
 * [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)  
 	
 	SICP is all about abstractions and general problem solving. One look at this book and you might think "No way am I reading that". From Berkely: [Why SICP Matters](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html)
 	
 * [The Art of SQL](https://www.amazon.com/Art-SQL-Stephane-Faroult/dp/0596008945)  

 	Make this your second book on SQL.

 * [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)

 * [The Mythical Man Month](https://github.com/tiy-greenville-front-end-fall-2016/overview/tree/master/assets/MythicalManMonth.pdf)
 
 	[Here's a 16 page excerpt](assets/MythicalManMonth.pdf) provided from Drexel University's CS451 Software Engineering class.
 
 * [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)
 
 * [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)
 
 * [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319)
 
 	Explains what the code you are writing is actually doing and how a CPU actually executes your code.
 
 * [The Inmates Are Running the Asylum](https://www.amazon.com/Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum-Products/dp/0672326140)
 

### Soft Skills

 * [The Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) In general, Joel's blog is excellent.
 * [Death By Meeting](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Meeting-Leadership-Solving-Business/dp/0787968056)
 * [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=QCSQEZBR0AEYNH4HY69Y)
 * [The Effective Executive](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=GCZ4A806EVYZ2MQ54W32)
 * [Managing The Unmanageable](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Unmanageable-Insights-Software-People/dp/032182203X)
 * [Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams](https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-Second/dp/0932633439)
